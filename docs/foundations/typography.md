# Typography

Apps designed for the Apple platforms use the [San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) typeface family. Websites or apps not built on Apple's platforms cannot use this typeface in any way with the exception of screenshots and mockups of iOS/iPadOS/macOS/watchOS/tvOS apps.&#x20;

[SF Pro](https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/design/resources/download/SF-Pro.dmg) is the standard typeface that should be used for all apps built for Apple's platforms. The font has 9 different weights, both uprights and italics.
