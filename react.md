# Bluelight React

### Component Attributes

<mark style="color:orange;">**Modifiers**</mark> are further properties, primarily stylistic, to a component that are declared in a `mods=""` attribute. Select modifiers are required to declare things like style, colour, and size, where no declared value may display a broken component. Whether a modifier is required or not is listed in the specific component's documentation page.
