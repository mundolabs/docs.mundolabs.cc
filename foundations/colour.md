# Colour

### System Colours

With the exception of `black` and `white`, all colours have 9 variations, 100 to 900 depending on darkness. Content overlay colour should depend on contrast levels. Contrast usage of black and white text is displayed in the system colours tables below. Specific colours should be reffered to as _colour_/_variant_. e.g. `blue/100`, `red/900`, or `white`. The slash (`/`) should be replaced with a hyphen (`-`) in any code.

Colours apart from the greyscale include a default colour, indicated in the system colours table with an extended width (e.g. `blue/400` and `red/500`).
